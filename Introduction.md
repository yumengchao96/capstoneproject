<h2>Introduction/Business Problem</h2>
    
The restaurant business is a competitive market for anyone to enter. As price war rages on, profits of restaurant owners are compromised. They must ensure that the quality of their offering is superior to their competitors while keeping the cost down. This is hard to manage; therefore, we suggest to help restaurant owner find a niche product offering that has less competition in order to boost higher margins.

In order to do this, we will take data from Foursquare and search for the most unique offering.

A restaurant owner requested to find a new item to sell as a specialy dish that is not commonly available in other restaurnats around him. We will look for the least common restaurant types around the area and report to him.
