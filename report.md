<b>Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.</b>

The restaurant business is a competitive market for anyone to enter. As price war rages on, profits of restaurant owners are compromised. They must ensure that the quality of their offering is superior to their competitors while keeping the cost down. This is hard to manage; therefore, we suggest to help restaurant owner find a niche product offering that has less competition in order to boost higher margins.


<b>Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.<b>
    
In order to do this, we will take data from Foursquare and search for the most unique offering.
    

<b>Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.<b>
    
We have searched for the most unique type of restaurant within a two kilometer radius from Mandy's in order to decide on the potential product offering.
    

<b>Results section where you discuss the results.<b>
    
The algorithm recommends Mexican as the food for the restaurant owner as this food category has the highest potential with least competition in downtown Montreal.
    
    
<b>Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.<b>
    
We definitely did not expect to find Mexican food as teh niche; it might be hard to integrate into Mandy's current product offering.
    
    
<b>Conclusion section where you conclude the report.<b>

In conclusion, we suggest Mandy's stick to their current offering but add a Mexican twist, e.g. Salsa Salad.
